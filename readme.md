## Introduction

"Green Trip" is a comprehensive project aimed at providing users with a platform to explore and engage with various points of interest, activities, and rewards, all while promoting eco-friendly and sustainable practices. The project encompasses different aspects of travel, leisure, and sustainability, offering a holistic experience for users.

## Concept and Features

1. **Points of Interest:** The project includes a collection of different places such as hotels, restaurants, and other attractions. These are referred to as "Points of Interest" (POIs), and users can explore and interact with them.

2. **Activities:** Within each point of interest, there are various activities available for users to participate in. These activities can range from pool parties to guided tours, adding an interactive and engaging element to the user experience.

3. **Rewards:** "Green Trip" promotes sustainability by offering rewards that users can earn and redeem. Users can accumulate points by engaging in eco-friendly behaviors, such as scanning QR codes at specific locations. These points can then be used to claim rewards like complimentary drinks or discounts at participating establishments.

4. **User Profiles:** Users have personalized profiles where they can track their points, bookings, and rewards. They can also update their personal information and manage their activities and bookings.

5. **Booking System:** Users can make bookings for points of interest and activities. They can choose the number of tickets or days, depending on the type of booking, and secure their spot for a specific time frame.

6. **Authentication and Security:** The project employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the platform's features.

7. **Admin Dashboard:** The project includes an admin dashboard for managing various aspects of the platform, such as creating and editing points of interest, activities, rewards, and regions. Admins can also manage user accounts and bookings.

- **Express.js**: Express.js is used to create robust and scalable APIs and handle various HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: The project utilizes MongoDB as the database to store user data, bookings, points of interest, activities, rewards, and more.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: JSON Web Tokens are employed for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Figma**: The project's design and layout are planned using Figma, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
